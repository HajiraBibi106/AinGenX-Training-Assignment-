Letâ€™s create a similar code focusing on a dataset like hotel booking data. We'll use the popular "Hotel Bookings" dataset available on Kaggle, which includes information on bookings, cancellations, customer demographics, and stay details. I'll cover the following key steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reading the dataset, handling missing values, and basic data cleaning.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics, plotting trends in booking cancellations, and customer preferences using visualizations.


3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on the data, such as calculating total stays or stay types (e.g., weekend vs. weekday).


4. Predictive Analysis: Building a basic classification model to predict booking cancellations.


5. Insights and Summary: Summarizing key insights from the analysis.
